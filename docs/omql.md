# Object matching query language


## OMQL description

OMQL is declarative language for generating patterns for matching POJOs. It follows general style of SQL queries with its
own quirks.

```
    SELECT * FROM com.example.MyObject WHERE name ~= "John.*" AND friendsCount > 3 
```

Only supported type of queries is `SELECT` and queries must follow followin pattern:

SELECT `<list-of-fields>` FROM `<class-name>` WHERE `<list-of-conditions>`

 In current implementation `<list-of-fields>` is ignored and can be either `*` or any list of valid Java identifiers
 separated with comma.
 
 `<class-name>` is either a fully-qualified Java class name or a short name of registered class (see below).
 
 `<list-of-conditions>` is a list (tree, to be precise) of conditions consisting of field comparison combined with logical 
 operators. List of supported operators depends on field type.
 
 |  Data type          | Operators supported                    |
 |:-------------------:|:---------------------------------------|
 | Numeric types       | `>`, `<`, `=`,  `!=`, `>=`, `<=`, `IN (list)` |
 | String              | `=`, `!=`, `~=`, `IN (list)`           |
 | Enum                | `=`, `!=`, `~=`, `IN (list)`           |
 | Object              | `=`, `!=`, `~=`, `IN (subquery)`       |
 
  
 ## Integrating queries into your code
 
 Queries are processed by `QueryCompiler` and result of the compilation is a `Condition` object that can be further
 compiled to either bytecode or reflective pattern. 
 
 ```java
    import net.ninjacat.omg.omql.QueryCompiler;
    import net.ninjacat.omg.patterns.Patterns;
    import net.ninjacat.omg.patterns.PatternCompiler;
    .
    .
    .
    final Condition condition = QueryCompiler.of("SELECT * FROM POJO WHERE things > 3000 AND otherThings = 0", POJO.class);
    final Pattern pattern = Patterns.compile(condition, PatternCompiler.forClass(POJO.class)); 
``` 

To compile a query into a condition one must provide list of classes used in that query. `QueryCompiler` uses this 
information to build type-correct conditions. `QueryCompiler` will register all provided classes and all return types of public methods. For example for classes in example below, only `Data` class has to be registered, `Subclass` class will be discovered automatically and this will allow queries on `subdata` field.

```java
    class Subclass {
        String getCode();
    }

    class Data {
        Subclass getSubdata();
    }
```

```java
    final Condition condition = QueryCompiler.of("SELECT * FROM Data WHERE subdata IN (SELECT * FROM Subclass WHERE code = '1533')", Data.class); // Works
    final Condition condition = QueryCompiler.of("SELECT * FROM SomeOtherData", Data.class); // May work, if SomeOtherData class exist outside package
    final Condition condition = QueryCompiler.of("SELECT * FROM com.example.SomeOtherData"); // Will work if com.example.SomeOtherData exists  
```
All registered classes can be referenced in `FROM` clause using their simple name, to use non-registered class, one 
must use fully-qualified name. The class must be available on classpath.

## Type-specific comparisons

### String

String support equality operations `=` and `!=` as well as regular expression operation `~=`. Strings can also be matched
against a list of possible values.
String literals must be enclosed in either single or double quotes.

```sql
    SELECT * FROM Object WHERE strField = 'SomeValue'
    SELECT * FROM Object WHERE strField != "SomeValue"
    SELECT * FROM Object WHERE strField ~= "(Some|Other)[vV]alue.*"
    SELECT * FROM Object WHERE strField IN ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D')
```

### Enums

Enum comparison support equality operations `=` and `!=` and find in list `IN` operator. Enum values must be enclosed
in single or double quotes and must match Enum values in Java enum class.

```sql
    SELECT * FROM Object WHERE weekDay = 'MONDAY'
    SELECT * FROM Object WHERE weekDay != "TUESDAY"
    SELECT * FROM Object WHERE weekDay ~= "S.*DAY"
    SELECT * FROM Object WHERE weekDay IN ('MONDAY', 'TUESDAY', 'FRIDAY')
```

As can be seen from example above enums can also be matched against regular expressions. This ability is not specific to
enums, any object can be matched to a regular expression. In that case object's `toString()` method is called and
its return value is matched against a regular expression.

### Objects

Object comparision support operators `IN` and `~=`. 

When using `IN` operator subquery is used instead of list. `FROM` expression in that subquery must contain type of the
object, `SELECT` expression is completely ignored and `IN` is considered to be matching when subquery returns a match.

For example following query will match objects where `person.homeAddress.city.equals("Toronto")` is true
```sql
    SELECT * FROM Person WHERE homeAddress IN (SELECT * FROM Address WHERE city = 'Toronto')
```
